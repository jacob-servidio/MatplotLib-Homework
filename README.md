# MatplotLib-Homework
The Power of Plots

After merging and cleaning the dataset the following plots were created to help in the analysis of the study.

-   a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
-  Created a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows  the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.
- Created a pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.
- Calculation of the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
  Additionally, using Matplotlib to generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
- (s185) is a mouse that was treated with Capomulin, I generated a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for that mouse.
- Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.
  Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin       treatment. Ploted the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot.
  
3 observations from the data and charts can be found at the top of the code file.
